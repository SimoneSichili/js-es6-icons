## Workflow
**#1** Define an array list of objects. Every object represent an icon with 3 properties: name, prefix, type and family.  
Use `forEach` function and `template literal` to print all icon names.  
**#2** Define an array of colors and combine every color with an icon.  
Display icons in different colors based on type.  
**#3** Add a `select` to filter the icons based on type. Fill the select options dynamically.  
Display the icons based on the selection.
